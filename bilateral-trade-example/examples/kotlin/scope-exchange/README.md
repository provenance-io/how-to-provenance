# Kotlin Scope Exchange Examples

## Project Prerequisites
* Java JDK 11 (install via an sdk manager, like SdkMan)
* Gradle for building/running the examples

To run an example, use the following command `./gradlew run -PmainClass=<example class name>` where `example class name` is like `MarkerOwnedScopeExchangeKt` (note the Kt suffix for Kotlin, the name is based off of file name). You will be prompted for the various inputs needed by the script.
