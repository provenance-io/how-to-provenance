# Scope Exchange Contract Example

This folder contains an example contract that can be used to transfer value between two parties without the need for an
intermediary to hold the asset/funds (the contract acts as escrow and holds the thing for sale and the funds purchasing that thing)
and then swaps the two to the appropriate parties atomically in one transaction.
